### Grid system

__What would be your CSS library of choice for the grid system? Implement it in the page__
<br/>
I chose bootstrap because I have time constraints and bootstrap provides a great solution for a grid system. Having more time I would consider using efficient CSS grids. Moreover, there are other CSS libraries such as foundation and I choose Bootstrap because I am more comfortable with it.

__If you had to align the elements of the page, what would be the alignment system of choice? Implement it in the page__
<br/>
My choice is to use flexbox. Flexbox provides different options to align items. I used Flexbox in several parts of the project and the code is available on GitHub.

__Setup the classes and html structure for this grid library__

### Slider system

__What would be your favorite slider library?__
<br/>
I use bootstrap’s slider(Carousel) because I already used bootstrap for the layout. This way no additional resource is required to add to the project. Setup a slider system for the 3 slides

_Setup a slider system for the 3 slides_

### Colors, fonts, sizes

__What font would you use and how would you call it in the page?__
<br/>
I used Noto Sans TC and Roboto from google fonts. I imported the font in style.scss file and Called in with “font-family” property. 

__Set up a base styling with colors, fonts, sizes in the page__

### Scripts

__Add a script to make a toggle for the mobile menu__



# My process:

### 1- Added git to the project for version control.

There are many benefits to use a version control system and I decided to use git because:

- I want to take advantage of these benefits
- I have the most experience with it
- it is one of the best ones.

### 2- Bug Found!

the header.scss file was incorrectly named footer.scss


### 3- Designed UI with Adobe Xd
designed the initial user interface and layout based on the project requirements.

![initial design picture](https://github.com/shahryar-h/sherweb-test-integration/blob/main/imgs/initial-design.png?raw=true)

I added some pictures instead of the placeholder just because it looks better. it can easily change back to the placeholder by changing the source.
I later added Sherweb's logo to the page instead of the logo's place holder


### 4- developed the layout using bootstrap
a simple layout. the slider and about section are adjacent only in large and bigger screen sizes.

### 5- added the slider
used bootstrap's Carousel. I intentionally removed the slider arrows as a design decision. the slider is customizable and different features can be added. 
added a separate folder for slider.scss 

### 6- toggle menu
added the toggle functionality to the menu 
changed the menu item's design

### 7- footer
styled footer and moved the copyright text to the top right side of the footer

### 8- added some aditional styling like:
- added fonts, text color and text size to different project's components
- box shadows for different parts of the project
- the menu's pop in/out animation
- hamburgur menu implementation

### 9- final refactoring and documentation
- used meaningful variables to increase readability, scalability.
- commented the code
- Documented the project in the readme.md file
